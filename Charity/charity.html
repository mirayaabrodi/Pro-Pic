        <p> The corona pandemic presents us all with enormous challenges. Millions of <br>people have been infected and
          in
          a short time some of the world's most<br> advanced healthcare systems have been paralyzed.
          <br><br>
          MSF follows developments and adapts our efforts to current local needs. We <br>use close to 50 years of
          experience in saving lives and protecting the most <br>vulnerable in major disease outbreaks.
          <br><br>
          That's why we work with the World Health Organization (WHO), so we can<br> be part of saving the world and
          doing
          good deeds. </p>

        <p>
          The world has never faced a crisis like COVID-19. The pandemic affects<br> communities around the world.
          Supporting a
          global response led by the <br> World Health Organization (WHO) has never
          been more urgent.<br>
          <br>
          <span class="draker-text"> <span class="darker-text">
              Donations support the work of WHO, including with partners, to track <br> and understand the spread of the
              virus;
              providing patients with the care <br> they need and receiving the necessary materials and information for
              <br> frontline
              employees; and accelerating the research and development <br> of vaccines and therapies for all who need
              them. <br></span>
            <br>
            Some donations also support additional UNICEF partners, the World <br> Food Program, the United Nations
            Refugee Agency
            (UNHCR), the United <br> Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Middle <br> East
            (UNRWA) and the
            CEPI Vaccine Development Alliance.</p>
